\title{
  Find Circular Shift of DWT Wavelet Coefficients
}
\description{
  Finds circular shift of DWT wavelet coefficients at a specified level,
  for a specified filter length.
}
\usage{
waveletshift.dwt(L, j, N = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{L}{Length of wavelet transform filter used.}
  \item{j}{Level of DWT wavelet coefficients to be shifted.}
  \item{N}{Length of original time series sample.}
}
\details{
  This function computes the circular shift associated with a wavelet
  transform filter of length \code{L} and level \code{j}. \code{L} must
  be of even length.

  Each coefficient's index will be circularly shifted forward by the
  value outputted. For example, if we have a vector of DWT wavelet
  coefficients (with NAs inserted) with indices 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and the
  value outputted from the function \code{waveletshift.dwt} is 2, the
  new order of the vector of aligned DWT wavelet coefficients would be
  7,8,1,2,3,4,5,6.

  If \code{N} is specified, the function will output the "shift" Modulo
  N. Because the shift is circular, the value outputted when N is
  specified is equivalent to the case when N is not specified.

  This function calculates the absolute value of vjG in formulas (114c)
  in \emph{Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis} by Percival and
  Walden (2000). (And optionally vjG Modulo N)
