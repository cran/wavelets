\usage{
\method{plot}{dwt}(x, levels = NULL, draw.boundary = FALSE, type = "stack",
col.plot = "black", col.boundary = "red", X.xtick.at = NULL, X.ytick.at
= NULL, Stack.xtick.at = NULL, Stack.ytick.at = NULL, X.xlab = "t",
y.rlabs = TRUE, plot.X = TRUE, plot.W = TRUE, plot.V = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An object of class \code{dwt}.}
  \item{levels}{Number, vector, or list of two vectors indicating range
    of levels to plot. See details.}
  \item{draw.boundary}{Logical value indicating whether to draw boundary
    coefficients.}
  \item{type}{Type of plot to draw. Currently only "stack" is
    implemented.}
  \item{col.plot}{Color of wavelet and scaling coefficients.}
  \item{col.boundary}{Color of boundary coefficient lines.}
  \item{X.xtick.at}{Vector specifying the extreme tick mark locations
    and the number of intervals between those extreme tick marks on the
    horizontal axis of the plot of the original times series. This
    vector takes the form similar to par("xaxp"), and is defaulted to
    par("xaxp") when \code{X.xtick.at} is not specified.}
  \item{X.ytick.at}{Vector specifying the extreme tick mark locations
    and the number of intervals between those extreme tick marks on the
    vertical axis of the plot of the original times series. This vector
    takes the form similar to par("yaxp"), and is defaulted to
    par("yaxp") when \code{X.ytick.at} is not specified.}
  \item{Stack.xtick.at}{Vector of form similar to \code{X.xtick.at}
    specifying the tick mark locations on the horizontal
    axis of the stacked plot. This is applicable only if \code{plot.X}
    is FALSE.}
  \item{Stack.ytick.at}{Vector of form similar to \code{X.ytick.at}
    specifying the tick mark locations on the vertical
    axis of the stacked plot. This is applicable only if \code{plot.X}
    is FALSE.}
  \item{X.xlab}{String specifying the label of the horizontal axis of
    the plot of the original time series.}
  \item{y.rlabs}{Logical flag indicating whether to draw the vertical
    labels on the right vertical axis of the stacked plot.  These labels
    indicate the number of boundary coefficients to the right of the
    right boundary line, and the level of decomposition of the wavelet
    (or scaling) coefficients.}
  \item{plot.X}{Logical flag indicating whether to draw original time
    series.}
  \item{plot.W}{Logical flag indicating whether to draw the wavelet
    coefficients in the stacked plot.}
  \item{plot.V}{Logical flag indicating whether to draw the scaling
    coefficients in the stacked plot.}  
  \item{...}{Additional paramters that are acceptable arguments to the
    generic \code{plot} function}
}
\details{
  \code{plot.dwt} plots the DWT wavelet and scaling coefficients. The
    \code{type} parameter species the type of plot, which is currently
    only stack. If the DWT object is defined for multiple time series,
    only the data pertaining to the first time series of the DWT object
    is plotted. Thus, only the wavelet coefficients and scaling
    coefficients of the first time series of the DWT object will be
    plotted.
    
    If a single number is specified for \code{levels}, then the wavelet
    coefficients of levels 1 through \code{levels} will be plotted.
    Otherwise, a vector or the first element of a list will specify
    which levels of the wavelet coefficients will be plotted.
    Unless specified in the second element of a list, only one level
    of scaling coefficients will be plotted and this level is equal
    to the highest level of the wavelet coefficients plotted.

    For each respective axis, the distance between a tick mark on the
    plot of the original time series is equivalent to the distance
    between a tick mark on the stacked plot. Thus, when altering the
    relative spacing of the tick marks on the plot of the original time
    series using \code{X.xtick.at} or \code{X.ytick.at}, the tick marks
    of the stacked plot are automatically adjusted. If the plot of the
    original time series is not drawn, then the user can alter the
    spacing of the tick marks using \code{Stack.xtick.at} and
    \code{Stack.ytick.at} for the horizontal and vertical axes,
    respectively.
    
    One of \code{plot.W} or \code{plot.V} must be TRUE.
