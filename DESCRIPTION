Depends: R (>= 2.10), methods
Description: Contains functions for computing and plotting
        discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) and maximal overlap discrete
        wavelet transforms (MODWT), as well as their inverses.
        Additionally, it contains functionality for computing and
        plotting wavelet transform filters that are used in the above
        decompositions as well as multiresolution analyses.
